# Lancer Nexus Coordinator

The Coordinator maintains cluster membership and makes placement decisions for Lancer Nexus game instances.

## Responsibilities

- Register Agents and game instances
- Track readiness, capacity, draining and failure state
- Assign players and groups to suitable instances
- Preserve group and formation affinity
- Reserve event-server capacity
- Coordinate transfers without owning the game simulation
- Expose operator and health information

The Coordinator is a control-plane service. It does not become the authoritative source for player inventory, credits or world state.

## Shared Protocol

The shared contracts are checked out in the `Protocol` submodule. Update it before local builds with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --remote --merge Protocol
```

CI performs the same update before restoring and building the Coordinator.

## Development

```bash
git submodule update --init --remote --merge Protocol
dotnet restore tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests.csproj
dotnet build tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore --warnaserror
dotnet test tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests/LancerNexus.Coordinator.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-build
```

The initial implementation provides deterministic placement policy for registered, ready, fresh and non-draining instances. It prefers group affinity, then lower utilization, and rejects requests when there is no eligible capacity. Registry persistence and authenticated Agent registration are deliberately separate follow-up work.
